 InkShield2
============

This board has been tested. It works quite well.

Periperials required are Polulo stepper drivers for
X, Y, Z1, and Z2, four endstops (optical gates),
an HP ink head, and a four-line I2C display with
four push buttons for menu selection.

Power supply is via a regular PC power brick
that is siply plugged into the shield. The voltage
needed for the Arduino Mega, all steppers, the SD
card connector, and the Ink Head are all taken 
from or generated from the PC power supply.

This is my original setup:
